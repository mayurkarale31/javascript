Data Types in JavaScript

The string
The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters, as shown below:

var a = 'Hi there!';  // using single quotes
var b = "Hi there!";  // using double quotes

The Number Data Type
The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation e.g. 1.5e-4 (equivalent to 1.5x10-4).

var a = 25;         // integer
var b = 80.5;       // floating-point number
var c = 4.25e+6;    // exponential notation, same as 4.25e6 or 4250000
var d = 4.25e-6;    // exponential notation, same as 0.00000425

The Boolean Data Type
The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false), etc. as demonstrated below:

var isReading = true;   // yes, I'm reading
var isSleeping = false; // no, I'm not sleeping

The Undefined Data Type
The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.

var a;
var b = "Hello World!"
 
alert(a) // Output: undefined
alert(b) // Output: Hello World!

The Null Data Type.
This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.
A variable can be explicitly emptied of its current contents by assigning it the null value.

var a = null;
alert(a); // Output: null
 
var b = "Hello World!"
alert(b); // Output: Hello World!
 
b = null;
alert(b) // Output: null

The Object Data Type
The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.
An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects. You'll learn more about objects in upcoming chapters.
The following example will show you the simplest way to create an object in JavaScript.

var emptyObject = {};
var person = {"name": "Clark", "surname": "Kent", "age": "36"};
 
// For better reading
var car = {
    "modal": "BMW X3",
    "color": "white",
    "doors": 5
}

The Array Data Type
An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index, and it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays. The array index starts from 0, so that the first array element is arr[0] not arr[1].
The simplest way to create an array is by specifying the array elements as a comma-separated list enclosed by square brackets, as shown in the example below:

var colors = ["Red", "Yellow", "Green", "Orange"];
var cities = ["London", "Paris", "New York"];
 
alert(colors[0]);   // Output: Red
alert(cities[2]);   // Output: New York

The Function Data Type
The function is callable object that executes a block of code. Since functions are objects, so it is possible to assign them to variables, as shown in the example below:

var greeting = function(){ 
    return "Hello World!"; 
}
 
// Check the type of greeting variable
alert(typeof greeting) // Output: function
alert(greeting());     // Output: Hello World!

The typeof Operator
The typeof operator can be used to find out what type of data a variable or operand contains. It can be used with or without parentheses (typeof(x) or typeof x).
The typeof operator is particularly useful in the situations when you need to process the values of different types differently, but you need to be very careful, because it may produce unexpected result in some cases, as demonstrated in the following example:

// Numbers
typeof 15;  // Returns: "number"
typeof 42.7;  // Returns: "number"
typeof 2.5e-4;  // Returns: "number"
typeof Infinity;  // Returns: "number"
typeof NaN;  // Returns: "number". Despite being "Not-A-Number"
 
// Strings
typeof '';  // Returns: "string"
typeof 'hello';  // Returns: "string"
typeof '12';  // Returns: "string". Number within quotes is typeof string
 
// Booleans
typeof true;  // Returns: "boolean"
typeof false;  // Returns: "boolean"
 
// Undefined
typeof undefined;  // Returns: "undefined"
typeof undeclaredVariable; // Returns: "undefined"
 
// Null
typeof Null;  // Returns: "object"
 
// Objects
typeof {name: "John", age: 18};  // Returns: "object"
 
// Arrays
typeof [1, 2, 4];  // Returns: "object"
 
// Functions
typeof function(){};  // Returns: "function"
